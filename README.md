The main development effort has done on user service, core, eureka server and other modules just bootstrapped and are not ready for use.
User service includes endpoints for therapists and specializations.

You can explore end points by following URI:

Minimal security is implemented in the user service, and you can log in with user: admin and password: 123456 credentials.
Currently, I have coded a User module, and you can run the project in the following order:

First run eureka server

Then run user service
